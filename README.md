# Chatbot Project
This is my Chatbot built using Google Generative AI "Gemini 2.0 flash", Python and Streamlit which is designed to assist users by answering queries and also providing customer support.
It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input in real-time.

## Key Features:
Conversational Interface: Interact with the bot through text-based inputs.
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes advanced NLP models to understand user queries.
Real-Time Responses: Instant responses to user inquiries based on pre-defined knowledge or dynamic data sources.
Customizable: Easily extend the bot's functionality by adding new intents or integrating APIs.

## How It Works:
User Input: Users type their query or message into the chat interface.
Processing: The chatbot processes the input using NLP techniques, such as tokenization, intent detection, and response generation.
Response: Based on the input, the bot provides an appropriate response from a predefined knowledge base or generates a new response using an AI model.
